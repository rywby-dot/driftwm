driftwm's command-line interface: the root command that starts the compositor,
and every `driftwm msg` subcommand for controlling a running one. For the raw
JSON wire protocol behind `msg`, see [ipc.md](ipc.md).

## `driftwm`

```
driftwm [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

A trackpad-first infinite canvas Wayland compositor.

With no subcommand, starts the compositor, auto-detecting the backend (udev on a TTY, winit when nested). The `msg` subcommand instead talks to an already-running instance over its IPC socket; see docs/ipc.md for the raw wire protocol.

- `--backend <udev|winit>` — Backend to use [default: udev on a TTY, winit if nested]
- `--config <PATH>` — Use an alternate config file
- `--check-config` — Validate the config and exit
- `--session-file <PATH>` — Durable session file path. Overrides the default; lets a nested winit dev session opt into session restore (it skips it otherwise)

### `driftwm msg`

```
driftwm msg [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>
```

Send a command to the running compositor over its IPC socket.

Auto-targets the instance named by `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` (override with `DRIFTWM_SOCKET`). A subcommand with no arguments reads state; with arguments it writes. Add `--json` for the raw JSON reply. A command that fails (bad value, no match, no focused window) prints an error to stderr and exits non-zero, so scripts can branch on it.

- `--json` — Print the raw JSON reply

#### `driftwm msg camera`

```
driftwm msg camera [X] [Y]
```

Get the camera position, or set it (animated) with `<x> <y>` (viewport center, Y-up).

With no arguments, prints the current camera position. With `<x> <y>`, pans the viewport (animated) to center that canvas point; positive `y` is up.

Reply: `{"Ok":{"Camera":{"x":500.0,"y":300.0}}}`.

#### `driftwm msg zoom`

```
driftwm msg zoom [LEVEL]
```

Get the zoom level, or set it with `<level>` (clamped to the supported range).

Setting is animated and clamped to the supported range (out to fit-all, in to native resolution — no magnification).

Reply: `{"Ok":{"Zoom":0.5}}`.

#### `driftwm msg layout`

```
driftwm msg layout [OPTIONS]
```

Print the active keyboard layout (full XKB name, e.g. `English (US)`).

With `--short`, prints the configured layout code for the active group (e.g. `us`, `ru`) instead — what most status bars want.

Reply: `{"Ok":{"Layout":"English (US)"}}` (or `"us"` with `--short`).

- `--short` — Print the configured layout code instead (e.g. `us`, `ru`)

#### `driftwm msg state`

```
driftwm msg state
```

Dump camera, zoom, and the window inventory.

Prints camera, zoom, keyboard layout, and every window — each with a stable `id` usable as a selector for `focus`/`move`/`close`/`screenshot window` — plus fullscreen, pinned, layer-shell, and per-output details.

Reply: `{"Ok":{"State":{"camera":[..],"zoom":1.0,"windows":[..],"outputs":[..]}}}`.

#### `driftwm msg debug-counters`

```
driftwm msg debug-counters
```

Print internal collection sizes for leak diagnosis (unstable keys).

An introspection endpoint, not a stable interface: the keys are internal field names that can change between releases. Meant for leak diagnosis — a window/surface/client-keyed count should return to its idle baseline once the windows and clients that raised it are gone (output-keyed counters follow output lifetimes instead and can persist across hotplug).

Reply: `{"Ok":{"DebugCounters":{"decorations":2,"stage_entries":2}}}`.

#### `driftwm msg subscribe`

```
driftwm msg subscribe
```

Stream state snapshots as they change (one JSON line per event with --json).

Turns the connection into a live feed: the server acks, then pushes one event with the current state immediately and again on every change — including camera/zoom, the window list, focus, window titles, keyboard layout, a per-output viewport, the screen-space inventory (pinned and fullscreen windows — dragging a pinned window pushes events), and layer/canvas-layer changes. While something animates an event is pushed per rendered frame (not throttled like the state file), so a pan or drag streams at the compositor's frame rate. Runs until interrupted.

Each event is `{"State":{..}}` — the whole snapshot, same shape as the `state` reply, and not wrapped in `Ok`/`Err`. A slow subscriber never blocks the compositor: it drops snapshots and catches up in full on the next change.

#### `driftwm msg focus`

```
driftwm msg focus [OPTIONS] [APP_ID]
```

Print the focused window, or focus a window by app_id substring or `--id` (the stable id shown in `state`).

With no argument, prints the focused window's `id` and `app_id`. Given an `app_id` substring (case-insensitive) or `--id <n>`, focuses that window, navigating to it only if it is off-screen.

Reply: `{"Ok":{"Focused":{"id":5,"app_id":"alacritty"}}}` (or `{"Ok":{"Focused":null}}`).

- `--id <ID>` — Focus the window with this stable id (from `state`)

#### `driftwm msg move`

```
driftwm msg move [OPTIONS] [X] [Y]
```

Get a window's position, or move it (center, Y-up) with `<x> <y>`. Targets the focused window, or `--id` (the stable id shown in `state`).

Positions are a center point with `y` pointing up. Pinned and fullscreen windows live in screen space, not on the canvas, so `move` refuses to reposition them.

Reply: `{"Ok":{"Position":{"x":100,"y":200}}}`.

- `--id <ID>` — Target the window with this stable id (from `state`)

#### `driftwm msg opacity`

```
driftwm msg opacity [OPTIONS] [VALUE]
```

Get a window's opacity, or set it with `<value>` (0.0–1.0). Targets the focused window, or `--id` (the stable id shown in `state`).

`0.0` is transparent, `1.0` opaque. Applies to any rendered window, pinned and fullscreen included; the change takes effect next frame. The value is runtime-only — seeded from an `opacity` window rule at map time, held for the session, and never persisted (it resets when the window or compositor restarts). Values outside `0.0`–`1.0` are rejected, not clamped; a window no rule touched reads `1`.

Reply: `{"Ok":{"Opacity":0.85}}`.

- `--id <ID>` — Target the window with this stable id (from `state`)

#### `driftwm msg close`

```
driftwm msg close [OPTIONS] [APP_ID]
```

Close the focused window, or a window by app_id substring or `--id`.

Targets the focused window by default, or a window by `app_id` substring (case-insensitive) or `--id <n>` (from `state`). Errors when nothing matches.

Reply: `{"Ok":"Ok"}`.

- `--id <ID>` — Close the window with this stable id (from `state`)

#### `driftwm msg suspend`

```
driftwm msg suspend [OPTIONS] [APP_ID]
```

Suspend the focused window, or a window by app_id substring or `--id`.

The same conversion as the `suspend-window` action, but addressable: it leaves a compositor-drawn stand-in in the window's place (relaunch it with `relaunch`, `Enter`, or a click) instead of asking the client to close. Targets the focused window by default, or a window by `app_id` substring (case-insensitive) or `--id <n>` (from `state`). When a live client and a stand-in share an `app_id`, the substring resolves to the live client — target the stand-in by `--id`.

Reply: `{"Ok":"Ok"}`.

- `--id <ID>` — Suspend the window with this stable id (from `state`)

#### `driftwm msg relaunch`

```
driftwm msg relaunch [OPTIONS] [APP_ID]
```

Relaunch a suspended window: the focused stand-in, or one by app_id substring or `--id`.

Spawns the suspended window's app from its `.desktop` entry and adopts the new window into the stand-in's slot on its first sized commit. Acts only on suspended stand-ins, so an `app_id` substring resolves straight to the matching stand-in (never a live client). Errors when nothing matches.

Reply: `{"Ok":"Ok"}`.

- `--id <ID>` — Relaunch the suspended window with this stable id (from `state`)

#### `driftwm msg action`

```
driftwm msg action <SPEC>...
```

Run a config action, e.g. `action close-window`, `action quit`, `action switch-layout next`.

Runs any compositor action by the same string you would write in a config keybinding, parsed with the exact config parser, so every keybindable action is reachable. Replies `Ok` whenever the spec parses — even if it had no effect (e.g. `close-window` with nothing focused); only an unparseable spec errors.

The dedicated `msg` commands are the state you can read or set; every one-shot operation (close a window, quit, zoom a step) lives here under `action`. Window actions target the focused window, so to act on a specific one, `focus` it first — or use the `--id` selector on `focus`/`move`/`close`/`screenshot window` to target any window without the focus-first dance.

The socket is a full control surface: `action` can `exec`/`spawn`, `quit`, and `reload-config`. It is safe only because the socket is `0600`.

Reply: `{"Ok":"Ok"}`.

- `<SPEC>...` — Action and arguments, exactly as written in config (e.g. `nudge-window up`)

#### `driftwm msg bookmark`

```
driftwm msg bookmark [OPTIONS] [NAME] [X] [Y]
```

List bookmarks, get/set one by `<name>`, or delete with `--delete`.

With no arguments, lists every bookmark (`name: [x, y]`, Y-up, sorted). Given a `<name>`, prints that bookmark's point; with `<name> <x> <y>`, creates or overwrites it at that canvas point (Y-up, window-center convention, same as `move`). `--delete <name>` removes one. Bookmarks store a position only, never zoom — jump to one with the `go-to-bookmark` action or a `mod+<n>` keybinding.

Reply: `{"Ok":{"Bookmark":{"x":500.0,"y":300.0}}}` (get/set), or `{"Ok":{"Bookmarks":{"home":[0.0,0.0]}}}` (list), or `{"Ok":"Ok"}` (delete).

- `[NAME]` — Bookmark name. Omit to list every bookmark
- `[X]` — X coordinate (Y-up). Requires `<y>`
- `[Y]` — Y coordinate (Y-up)
- `--delete` — Delete the named bookmark

#### `driftwm msg screenshot`

```
driftwm msg screenshot [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

Capture a canvas PNG (custom DPI). With no subcommand, captures the active output's current view of the canvas.

A canvas capture, not a screen grab: it re-renders a virtual viewport onto the canvas, reaching off-screen content at any resolution. Windows get full chrome (title bar, border, shadow); panels/layer-shells and blur are not drawn (use `grim` for a literal grab). `-o -` streams the PNG to stdout (e.g. `screenshot window -o - | wl-copy`).

Blur caveat: a scene capture (viewport/`all`/`region`) shows a translucent window over a sharp backdrop, never a blurred one; a `window` capture keeps the translucency over transparent pixels. A gigapixel TIFF wallpaper uses a coarse pyramid level, softening at extreme `--scale`. Captures tile internally but cap at 16384 px/side.

Reply: `{"Ok":{"Screenshot":{"path":"/abs/shot.png","width":1920,"height":1080}}}`.

- `--scale <SCALE>` — Pixels per canvas unit — higher captures more detail than the screen shows, independent of zoom (default: `1`)
- `-o, --output <OUTPUT>` — Output PNG path, or `-` for stdout [default: `./driftwm-screenshot-<time>.png`]

##### `driftwm msg screenshot window`

```
driftwm msg screenshot window [OPTIONS] [APP_ID]
```

The focused window, or a window by app_id substring or `--id`.

Composed alone on transparency, so overlapping windows never appear; pinned and fullscreen windows capture like any other (a fullscreen window has no chrome). Reply shape is the shared `Screenshot` reply above.

- `--id <ID>` — Capture the window with this stable id (from `state`)

##### `driftwm msg screenshot all`

```
driftwm msg screenshot all
```

The bounding box of all non-widget windows.

A scene with the canvas background plus every window's chrome, framed with a `[zoom] fit_padding` margin. Reply shape is the shared `Screenshot` reply above.

##### `driftwm msg screenshot region`

```
driftwm msg screenshot region [OPTIONS] <COORDS>...
```

A rectangle — `X Y W H` (canvas coords, center/Y-up) or slurp's native `X,Y WxH`. Commas and the `x` separator are tolerated, so `$(slurp)` drops in directly. Treated as output-screen pixels with `--from-screen`.

Captures a scene (canvas background plus window chrome) over the rectangle. Reply shape is the shared `Screenshot` reply above.

- `<COORDS>...` — Four ints `X Y W H`, or slurp's `X,Y WxH` (quoted or not)
- `--from-screen` — Treat the rectangle as output-screen pixels mapped via the active viewport

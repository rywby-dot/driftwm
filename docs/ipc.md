# IPC

driftwm exposes a small IPC over a Unix domain socket so external tools and
scripts can query and control the running compositor. The `driftwm msg`
subcommand is the built-in client; the wire protocol is plain line-delimited
JSON, so any language can speak it directly.

## `driftwm msg`

Run `driftwm msg <command>` from inside a driftwm session. The commands —
`camera`, `zoom`, `focus`, `move`, `opacity`, `close`, `suspend`, `relaunch`,
`layout`, `action`, `bookmark`, `screenshot`, `state`, `subscribe`, and
`debug-counters` — with their arguments, flags, and JSON reply shapes are
documented in the generated [CLI reference](cli.md); `driftwm msg <command> --help`
prints the same for one command. The conventions they share follow below.

`camera`, `zoom`, `focus`, `move`, `opacity`, and `bookmark` read when given no
arguments and write when given arguments. The others don't follow that rule:
`action` requires its arguments, `close`/`suspend`/`relaunch` act on the focused
window when given no selector, and `layout`, `screenshot`, `state`, `subscribe`,
and `debug-counters` need no arguments at all. A command that fails (bad value,
no focused window, no match) prints an error to stderr and exits non-zero, so
scripts can branch on it.

Add `--json` to print the raw JSON reply. The default output is a human-readable
rendering for a terminal, not a stable format — parse `--json`, or the
[state file](#state-file), in scripts.

### Coordinates

Window and camera positions use the same convention as
[window rules](window-rules.md) and the [state file](#state-file): a **center**
point, with **Y pointing up**. `move 0 0` centers the focused window on the
origin, `camera 0 0` centers the viewport there, and positive `y` is above.
Pinned and fullscreen windows live in screen space, not on the canvas, so `move`
refuses to reposition them.

### Suspended windows

A [suspended window](session.md) — the compositor-drawn stand-in left behind by
`suspend-window` or `suspend_on_close` — appears in the `windows` inventory with
its own `id` and `suspended: true`. `focus`, `move`, and `close` (which
dismisses the stand-in rather than asking a nonexistent client to close) take
that id like any window's; `suspend <selector>` turns a live window into a
stand-in, and `relaunch <selector>` starts its app again.

When a live client and a stand-in share an `app_id`, an app_id selector resolves
to the **live client** — target the stand-in by its `id`. `relaunch` is the
exception: it only ever acts on stand-ins, so an app_id selector there resolves
straight to the matching one.

Between a `relaunch` and the new window's first *sized* commit (when it takes
over the stand-in's slot), a snapshot lists both entries — count windows by
`id`, not `app_id`.

### Screenshots

`screenshot` re-renders the canvas rather than copying the framebuffer, so it
reaches off-screen content; its four targets, flags, and caveats are in the
[CLI reference](cli.md#driftwm-msg-screenshot) and their wire forms in
[Requests](#requests).

### Subscribing to changes

`subscribe` turns the connection into a live feed instead of polling: one event
per change (per rendered frame while something animates), each a whole-state
snapshot rather than a granular event type (window-opened, focus-changed, …) —
diff consecutive snapshots if you need the delta. Nothing is pushed while
nothing changes. Mechanics are in the
[CLI reference](cli.md#driftwm-msg-subscribe); the wire-level event shape is
under [Events](#events) below.

A one-liner that prints the focused window's `app_id` whenever anything changes:

```bash
driftwm msg --json subscribe \
  | jq --unbuffered -r '.State.windows[] | select(.is_focused) | .app_id'
```

A small daemon that dims whatever loses focus and restores full opacity to
whatever gains it (a snapshot arrives per rendered frame during a pan, so the
focused id is deduped against the last one seen):

```bash
prev=
driftwm msg --json subscribe \
  | jq --unbuffered -r '.State.windows[] | select(.is_focused) | .id' \
  | while read -r id; do
      [ "$id" = "$prev" ] && continue   # same focus, skip repeats
      [ -n "$prev" ] && driftwm msg opacity 0.7 --id "$prev"
      driftwm msg opacity 1 --id "$id"
      prev=$id
  done
```

### Debug counters

`debug-counters` reports the sizes of the compositor's internal per-window,
per-surface, and per-client collections; its keys are **unstable** internal
field names. See the [CLI reference](cli.md#driftwm-msg-debug-counters).

## Wire protocol

The socket path is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/driftwm/ipc-<WAYLAND_DISPLAY>.sock`
(permissions `0600`). The name is derived from the compositor's `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`,
so each instance owns a distinct socket and a client launched inside a session
automatically targets that session. Set `DRIFTWM_SOCKET` to point a client at an
explicit path.

> [!WARNING]
> The socket is a full control surface, not a read-only one: `action` can run
> `exec`/`spawn`, `quit`, and `reload-config`, and `relaunch` launches a
> suspended window's app. It is `0600` for that reason — don't loosen the
> permissions or bridge it over a network.

The protocol is one JSON **request** per line, answered by one JSON **reply**
per line. A single connection may carry several requests; the connection stays
open until the client closes it.

A reply is `{"Ok": <response>}` on success or `{"Err": "message"}` on failure.

A window can be targeted by a **selector**: a JSON number is its stable `id`
(from `state`), a JSON string is a case-insensitive `app_id` substring.

{"Ok":{"State":{"camera":[-960.0,-600.0],"zoom":1.0,"layout":"English (US)",
  "layout_short":"us","windows":[
  {"id":3,"app_id":"foot","title":"~","position":[0,0],"size":[800,480],
   "is_focused":true,"is_widget":false,"suspended":false}
]}}}
{"Err":"no focused window"}
```

The `windows` array is the same shape driftwm writes to its [state file](#state-file),
focused window first — but only while something is focused; with nothing focused
no entry is promoted, so filter on `is_focused` instead of indexing `windows[0]`.
Each entry's `id` is a stable per-session window handle — pass it back as a
selector to `focus`, `move`, `close`, `suspend`, `relaunch`, or
`screenshot window`. `suspended` marks a compositor-drawn stand-in rather than a
live client — see [Suspended windows](#suspended-windows).
The reply also carries `layout` (full XKB name) and `layout_short` (the
configured code for the active group); `fullscreen` and `pinned` (screen-space
windows, each carrying an `id` too — a `pinned` entry's `position`/`size` are in
rule coordinates, output-relative, so they paste straight into a
`pinned_to_screen` rule); `layers` (namespaces of screen-space layer-shell
surfaces); `canvas_layers` (canvas-positioned layers with rule-coordinate
position and size); and `outputs` (per-output `name`, viewport `camera` (center,
Y-up), `zoom`, logical `size`, `active` flag, and `active_bookmark`).

`active_bookmark` (top-level) is the focused output's active bookmark — the
bookmark nearest the viewport's usable center among those currently visible, or
`null` when none is in view. Each `outputs` entry carries its own
`active_bookmark` for that output's viewport. This is the same value the
`ext-workspace-v1` protocol marks `active`, so a bar can highlight the current
bookmark.

### Events

A `subscribe` connection doesn't get `Ok`/`Err` replies after the initial ack;
it gets one-way **event** lines:

```json
{"State":{"camera":[-960.0,-600.0],"zoom":1.0,"layout":"English (US)","layout_short":"us","windows":[...],"outputs":[...]}}
```

The `State` payload is identical to the `state` reply's, so anything that reads
one reads the other.

### Talking to the socket directly

```bash
SOCK="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/driftwm/ipc-$WAYLAND_DISPLAY.sock"

echo '"State"'            | socat -t1 - UNIX-CONNECT:"$SOCK"
echo '{"Camera":[500,300]}' | socat -t1 - UNIX-CONNECT:"$SOCK"
```

## State file

For read-only polling (status bars, scripts), driftwm also writes a throttled
(~10 Hz) snapshot to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/driftwm/state` — one `key=value` per
line. Reading that file avoids a socket round-trip when you only need to
observe; when you'd rather be pushed than poll, use
[`subscribe`](#subscribing-to-changes) instead.

| Key                                             | Value                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x`, `y`, `zoom`                                | The focused output's viewport                                  |
| `layout`, `layout_short`                        | Full XKB name, and the configured code for the active group    |
| `saved_x`, `saved_y`, `saved_zoom`              | The stored home-return viewport, when there is one             |
| `windows`                                       | JSON array, entries shaped like `state`'s                      |
| `layers`                                        | Comma-separated layer-shell namespaces                         |
| `canvas_layers`                                 | JSON array of canvas-positioned layers                         |
| `outputs.<name>.camera_x`, `.camera_y`, `.zoom` | That output's viewport                                         |
| `outputs.<name>.fullscreen`                     | JSON object: `id`, `app_id`, `title`                           |
| `outputs.<name>.pinned`                         | JSON array: `id`, `app_id`, `title`, `position`, `size`        |

A key with nothing to report is omitted, not written empty: no windows means no
`windows=` line at all, no layer surfaces no `layers=` line, and an output with
nothing fullscreen or pinned gets neither of its screen-space lines. Only `x`,
`y`, `zoom`, `layout`, `layout_short`, and the per-output camera lines are
always present.

Every published coordinate is a **center** with **Y-up**, matching `state` and
window rules. `x=`/`y=`/`zoom=` are the focused output's viewport, and each
output also reports its own under `outputs.<name>.camera_x`,
`outputs.<name>.camera_y`, and `outputs.<name>.zoom` — the same convention as
the `state` reply's per-output `camera` and `zoom`, rounded for the file.

`layers=` namespaces are the `app_id` a window rule matches a layer surface by.
A `canvas_layers` entry's `position` is derived from the surface's current size,
so it can drift from the rule that placed it if the surface resized after
mapping.

# IPC

driftwm exposes a small IPC over a Unix domain socket so external tools and
scripts can query and control the running compositor. The `driftwm msg`
subcommand is the built-in client; the wire protocol is plain line-delimited
JSON, so any language can speak it directly.

## `driftwm msg`

Run `driftwm msg <command>` from inside a driftwm session. Each command reads
when given no arguments and writes when given arguments.

| Command          | Example                       | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `camera`         | `driftwm msg camera`          | Print the camera position (viewport center)                                                          |
| `camera <x> <y>` | `driftwm msg camera 500 300`  | Center the viewport on `(x, y)` (animated)                                                           |
| `zoom`           | `driftwm msg zoom`            | Print the zoom level                                                                                 |
| `zoom <level>`   | `driftwm msg zoom 0.5`        | Set zoom (animated); clamped to the supported range (out to fit-all, in to native)                   |
| `focus`          | `driftwm msg focus`           | Print the focused window's `id` and `app_id` (e.g. `#5 alacritty`)                                   |
| `focus <app_id>` | `driftwm msg focus alacritty` | Focus a window by `app_id` substring (case-insensitive), or `--id <n>` (from `state`); navigates to it only if it's off-screen |
| `move`           | `driftwm msg move`            | Print the focused window's position (or `--id <n>`'s)                                                |
| `move <x> <y>`   | `driftwm msg move 100 200`    | Move the focused window, or `--id <n>`                                                               |
| `close`          | `driftwm msg close`           | Close the focused window, a window by `app_id` substring, or `--id <n>`                              |
| `layout`         | `driftwm msg layout`          | Print the active keyboard layout (full XKB name); `--short` prints the configured code (e.g. `ru`)   |
| `action <spec>`  | `driftwm msg action zoom-in`  | Run any config action (see [Actions](#actions))                                                      |
| `screenshot ...` | `driftwm msg screenshot`      | Capture the canvas to a PNG — current view, window, region, or all (see [Screenshots](#screenshots)) |
| `state`          | `driftwm msg state`           | Dump camera, zoom, and the window inventory (each window has a stable `id`)                          |
| `subscribe`      | `driftwm msg subscribe`       | Stream state snapshots: the current one immediately, then one on every change (`--json` for line-delimited JSON, see [Subscribing to changes](#subscribing-to-changes)) |

Add `--json` to print the raw JSON reply instead of the human-readable form:

```bash
driftwm msg --json state
```

A command that fails (bad value, no focused window, no match) prints an error to
stderr and exits non-zero, so scripts can branch on it.

### Actions

`action` runs any compositor action by the same string you'd write in a config
keybinding — arguments and all. The compositor parses it with the exact parser
the config file uses, so every keybindable action is reachable:

```bash
driftwm msg action zoom-in
driftwm msg action nudge-window up
driftwm msg action go-to 100 200
driftwm msg action switch-layout next     # next | prev | <index>
driftwm msg action close-window           # close the focused window
driftwm msg action quit                   # shut the compositor down
```

The dedicated commands above are the state you can **read or set**; every
**one-shot** operation (closing a window, quitting, zooming a step) lives under
`action` rather than as its own command.

Window actions operate on the **focused** window, so to act on a specific one
via `action`, select it first:
`driftwm msg focus alacritty && driftwm msg action close-window`. The dedicated
`focus`, `move`, `close`, and `screenshot window` commands can instead target
any window directly by its `id` from `state` (`--id <n>`), so the focus-first
dance is no longer required for those.

Switching the keyboard layout is `action switch-layout next|prev|<index>`; read
the current layout with `layout` (full XKB name, e.g. `Russian`) or `layout
--short` for the configured code (e.g. `ru`) — what most status bars want. The
short form indexes the `input.keyboard.layout` list by the active group, so it
mirrors exactly what you configured.

`action` replies `Ok` whenever the spec **parses** — even if the action had no
effect (e.g. `close-window` with nothing focused). Only an unparseable spec
returns `Err`. The dedicated query/set commands above, by contrast, can report a
failed lookup or bad value.

> [!WARNING]
> The IPC socket is a full control surface, not a read-only one: `action` can
> run `exec`/`spawn` (launch programs), `quit`, and `reload-config`. It's safe
> only because the socket is `0600` (your user only) — anything that can open it
> could already run programs as you. So don't loosen the permissions or bridge it
> over a network for "just reading state": that hands arbitrary code execution to
> whoever reaches it.

### Coordinates

Window and camera positions use the same convention as
[window rules](window-rules.md) and the [state file](#state-file): positions are
a **center** point, with **Y pointing up**. So `move 0 0` centers the focused
window on the canvas origin, `camera 0 0` centers the _viewport_ on the origin,
and positive `y` is above it. Pinned and fullscreen windows live in screen
space, not on the canvas, so `move` refuses to reposition them.

### Screenshots

`screenshot` is a **canvas capture**, not a screen grab: it re-renders a virtual
viewport onto the canvas (reaching off-screen content at any resolution) instead
of copying the framebuffer like `grim`. Windows get full chrome (title bar,
border, rounded corners, shadow). **Panels/layer-shells and blur aren't drawn** —
use `grim` for a literal screen grab.

```bash
driftwm msg screenshot                                # active output's current view
driftwm msg screenshot window                         # focused window, isolated
driftwm msg screenshot window --id 3                  # a specific window by id, isolated
driftwm msg screenshot all --scale 2                  # all windows + background, 2× detail
driftwm msg screenshot region 0 0 2000 1500           # canvas rect (center, Y-up)
driftwm msg screenshot region $(slurp) --from-screen  # pick a region with slurp
driftwm msg screenshot window -o - | wl-copy          # capture window to clipboard
```

Targets: **no subcommand** = the active output's viewport (what you see, minus
panels); **`window`** (optionally `<app_id>` or `--id <n>`) = just that window
(defaulting to the focused one) composed alone on transparency, so overlapping
windows never appear — pinned and fullscreen windows capture like any other
(a fullscreen window has no chrome); **`all`** / **`region`** = a scene with the
canvas background + every window's chrome (`all` adds a `[zoom] fit_padding`
margin).

- `--scale N` — pixels per canvas unit (default `1`); higher captures more detail
  than the screen shows, independent of zoom.
- `region X Y W H` — canvas coords (center, Y-up). With `--from-screen` they're
  screen pixels; slurp's native `X,Y WxH` is accepted, so `region $(slurp)` works.
- `-o PATH` — destination, or `-` for stdout (default
  `./driftwm-screenshot-<time>.png`); the written path is printed.

> [!NOTE]
> Caveats: no blur — in a scene capture (`all`/`region`/viewport) a translucent
> window shows a sharp backdrop instead of a blurred one, while a `window` capture
> keeps the translucency over transparent pixels (nothing is behind it to blur);
> a gigapixel TIFF wallpaper uses a coarse pyramid level (softens at extreme
> `--scale`); captures tile internally but cap at 16384 px/side.

### Subscribing to changes

`subscribe` turns the connection into a live feed instead of polling. The client
sends one request, the server acks it, then pushes an **event** line for the
current state immediately and again on every change, piggybacking on the
[state file](#state-file)'s change detection but **not** on its ~10 Hz throttle:
while something is changing, an event is pushed per rendered frame, so a camera
pan or window drag streams at the compositor's frame rate (smooth enough to
animate a minimap from). Nothing is pushed while nothing changes — render from
the latest received snapshot rather than in lockstep with events. Changes to
camera/zoom, the window inventory, focus, window **titles**, keyboard layout, and
per-output viewports all trigger a push.

Each event is `{"State":{...}}` — the **whole** snapshot, same shape as the
`state` reply, and **not** wrapped in `Ok`/`Err` (events are one-way). Because
every event is complete, a consumer can just re-render, or diff against the
previous one. A subscriber that stalls (stops reading) never blocks the
compositor — it just misses snapshots until it drains its socket, then catches
up in full on the next change.

```bash
# Print the focused window's app_id whenever anything changes.
driftwm msg --json subscribe | jq -r '.State.windows[0].app_id'

# Human-readable blocks, one per change, separated by a blank line.
driftwm msg subscribe
```

## Wire protocol

The socket path is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/driftwm/ipc-<WAYLAND_DISPLAY>.sock`
(permissions `0600`). The name is derived from the compositor's `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`,
so each instance owns a distinct socket and a client launched inside a session
automatically targets that session. Set `DRIFTWM_SOCKET` to point a client at an
explicit path.

The protocol is one JSON **request** per line, answered by one JSON **reply**
per line. A single connection may carry several requests; the connection stays
open until the client closes it.

A reply is `{"Ok": <response>}` on success or `{"Err": "message"}` on failure.

A window can be targeted by a **selector**: a JSON number is its stable `id`
(from `state`), a JSON string is a case-insensitive `app_id` substring.

> [!NOTE]
> The `Move` request and the `Window` screenshot target changed shape in this
> release: the old `{"Move":[x,y]}` tuple and bare `"Window"` string forms are
> gone (replaced by the object forms below). The `Focused` reply also grew from
> a bare app_id string to `{"id":…,"app_id":…}`.

### Responses

```json
{"Ok":{"Camera":{"x":500.0,"y":300.0}}}
{"Ok":{"Zoom":0.5}}
{"Ok":{"Layout":"English (US)"}}    // or "us" for {"Layout":{"short":true}}
{"Ok":{"Focused":{"id":5,"app_id":"alacritty"}}}   // or {"Ok":{"Focused":null}}
{"Ok":{"Position":{"x":100,"y":200}}}
{"Ok":"Ok"}                          // action / close
{"Ok":{"State":{"camera":[-960.0,-600.0],"zoom":1.0,"layout":"English (US)",
  "layout_short":"us","windows":[
  {"id":3,"app_id":"foot","title":"~","position":[0,0],"size":[800,480],
   "is_focused":true,"is_widget":false}
]}}}
{"Err":"no focused window"}
```

The `windows` array is the same shape driftwm writes to its [state file](#state-file),
focused window first. Each entry's `id` is a stable per-session window handle —
pass it back as a selector to `focus`, `move`, `close`, or `screenshot window`.
The reply also carries `layout` (full XKB name) and `layout_short` (the
configured code for the active group); `fullscreen` and `pinned` (screen-space
windows, which carry an `id` too); `layers` (namespaces of screen-space
layer-shell surfaces); `canvas_layers` (canvas-positioned layers with
rule-coordinate position and size); and `outputs` (per-output `name`, viewport
`camera` (center, Y-up), `zoom`, logical `size`, and `active` flag).

### Events

A `subscribe` connection doesn't get `Ok`/`Err` replies after the initial ack;
it gets one-way **event** lines:

```json
{"State":{"camera":[-960.0,-600.0],"zoom":1.0,"layout":"English (US)","layout_short":"us","windows":[...],"outputs":[...]}}
```

The `State` payload is identical to the `state` reply's, so anything that reads
one reads the other.

### Talking to the socket directly

```bash
SOCK="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/driftwm/ipc-$WAYLAND_DISPLAY.sock"

echo '"State"'            | socat -t1 - UNIX-CONNECT:"$SOCK"
echo '{"Camera":[500,300]}' | socat -t1 - UNIX-CONNECT:"$SOCK"
```

## State file

For read-only polling (status bars, scripts), driftwm also writes a throttled
(~10 Hz) snapshot to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/driftwm/state` — `key=value` lines plus a
`windows=` JSON array using the same window shape as `state`. Reading that file
avoids a socket round-trip when you only need to observe; when you'd rather be
pushed than poll, use [`subscribe`](#subscribing-to-changes) instead.

Layer-shell clients appear too: `layers=` lists the namespaces of screen-space
layer surfaces (bars, OSKs, overlays — useful for finding the `app_id` a
window rule should match), and `canvas_layers=` is a JSON array of
canvas-positioned layers with their namespace, rule-coordinate `position`, and
`size` (the position reflects the current size, so it can drift from the
placing rule if the surface resized after mapping).

## Limitations

- `subscribe` events are whole-state snapshots, not granular event types
  (window-opened, focus-changed, …) — diff consecutive snapshots if you need
  the delta.

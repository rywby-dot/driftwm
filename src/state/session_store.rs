//! Compositor-side glue for the durable session store (session restore): build
//! an envelope from live state, write it through the [`driftwm::session`] IO,
//! and materialize it back into suspended windows at startup.
//!
//! Cadence: a create or dismiss writes immediately; a move or resize arms a
//! short debounce timer; graceful shutdown fsync's a final write. Suspended
//! windows are saved regardless of `restore_windows`; a live window is saved as
//! a `Quit` record when that flag resolves on for it (global default or a
//! per-app rule). `path == None` disables everything (a
//! winit dev session without `--session-file`, or a fixture without an
//! injected path).

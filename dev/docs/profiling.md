# Profiling driftwm

driftwm is instrumented with [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) behind
the `profile-with-tracy` cargo feature. The feature compiles out completely
when off — no runtime or binary cost in normal builds — so the instrumentation
stays in the tree permanently.

## 1. Build the Tracy server (one time)

The GUI/CLI server must match the `tracy-client` crate version in `Cargo.toml`
(currently 0.18.x → Tracy v0.13.x). Distro packages are often mismatched or
ship no aarch64 GUI, so build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy ~/tracy
cd ~/tracy
git checkout v0.13.1          # match the tracy-client version table
# GUI (optional, needs GTK/wayland dev libs):
cmake -B profiler/build -S profiler -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build profiler/build -j2     # -j2: template-heavy, ~1-2 GB/core
# CSV exporter (required for dev/scripts/tracy_analyze.py):
cmake -B csvexport/build -S csvexport -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build csvexport/build -j2
```

If GCC rejects `tracy_robin_hood.h` (`UINT64_C not declared`), add
`#include <cstdint>` near the top of `~/tracy/server/tracy_robin_hood.h`.

## 2. Capture

```sh
cargo run --release --features profile-with-tracy            # udev (from a TTY)
cargo run --release --features profile-with-tracy -- ...     # winit (nested)
```

Connect the live GUI (`~/tracy/profiler/build/tracy-profiler`) before or during
the run, then **drive the interaction you want to measure** (pan, zoom, a
window animation). Save the capture to a `.tracy` file from the GUI.

Tips for a clean capture:
- Profile one interaction at a time on an **empty canvas** when measuring the
  background, so the background dominates the frame.
- Pan/animate *continuously* for several seconds — steady-state cadence matters
  more than one-off frames.
- The render loop parks when nothing moves, so idle pauses appear as
  multi-second frame intervals. The analyzer filters these out (see below).

Cargo features:
- `profile-with-tracy` — spans + frame marks.
- `profile-with-tracy-ondemand` — only profiles while a server is connected.
- `profile-with-tracy-allocations` — also profile the global allocator.

## 3. Analyze

```sh
dev/scripts/tracy_analyze.py CAPTURE.tracy
```

Reports per-zone exec times and the **active** frame cadence (idle gaps >100 ms
removed), classified by vblank multiple (1 vblank ≈ 60 fps, 2 ≈ 30 fps).

The analyzer is generic: when a code path emits a Tracy *plot*, bucket frame
times by it. The chunked tile-bg plots `bg_chunks.target_lod`, so:

```sh
dev/scripts/tracy_analyze.py CAPTURE.tracy --bucket-by bg_chunks.target_lod
```

gives per-LOD frame-time tables (both exec time and frame-to-frame interval —
the interval table is the one that shows stutter). Any future plot works the
same way — add the plot in the code, pass its name to `--bucket-by`, no script
change needed. For the winit backend, pass `--frame-zone winit::frame` (the
default is `udev::render_frame`).

Per-frame diagnostic plots emitted by the compositor:

- `frame.commits` — wl_surface commits since the previous rendered frame
  (udev only; reset every render, so single-output sessions only). Bucketing
  intervals by this tests whether stutter correlates with client rendering
  activity (GPU contention from client work).
- `frame.visible_windows` / `frame.shadow_elems` — composition load per frame,
  emitted from compose_frame (both backends). Bucketing by these tests whether
  stutter scales with window/shadow count.

`--gpu` adds GPU zone stats (smithay's `tracy_gpu_profiling` timer queries),
split by proximity to slow frames. Reading it: if *fixed-work* zones (`clear`,
`draw_solid`) stretch near slow frames while their calm medians stay normal,
the whole GPU is intermittently stalled/contended — pointing at GPU contention
(e.g. client rendering) or power-state dips rather than any one expensive
shader.

The script finds `tracy-csvexport` via `$TRACY_CSVEXPORT`, then PATH, then
`~/tracy/csvexport/build/`.

## Where instrumentation lives

- `src/main.rs` — Tracy client startup + optional profiling allocator.
- `src/backend/udev.rs` / `src/backend/winit.rs` — per-frame span + frame mark.
  udev `render_frame` splits into `udev::build_cursor_elements`,
  `udev::compositor_render_frame`, `udev::queue_frame`, `udev::captures`,
  `udev::post_render`.
- `src/render/mod.rs` — `compose_frame` span, split into `compose::windows`,
  `compose::layers`, `compose::blur`.
- `src/render/shader_chunks.rs` — `ShaderChunkCache::render_elements` span, with a
  per-bake `bake::alloc` / `bake::render` split.
- `src/render/tile_chunks.rs` — chunked tile-bg spans + `bg_chunks.*` plots.
